# Pipelined-MIPS-Processor
This projects is a five stage pipelined MIPS processor with mitigation strategies to solve data and control hazards. It has been implemented and simulated on Vivado 2020.2 and coded entirely in Verilog. .

# Instructions on how to open the Project
You can clone the folder in any suitable folder on your machine using the command 

`git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Mundada/Pipelined-MIPS-Processor.git`

After clong the project, open the project in Xilinx Vivado software (minimum version required 2020.2 or higher). Or alternatively, you can also go inside

`/Xilinx/` and double click on `mips.xpr` to automatically open in your Vivado Software.

# Documentation
All the relevant documentation is present in the `/Reports/` folder, along with a hand-drawn circuit of the whole processor.

# Circuit Implementation using the Vivado Block Designer tool
